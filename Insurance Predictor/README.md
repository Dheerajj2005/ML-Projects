# Insurance Charges Predictor

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts insurance charges based on several factors: age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and sex.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate insurance charges for individuals. This model can be useful for insurance companies to assess risk and determine premiums, as well as for individuals to understand potential insurance costs.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is typically available from public sources like Kaggle or can be simulated. It includes the following features:

* **age:** Age of the insured person.
* **bmi:** Body mass index of the insured person.
* **smoker:** Smoking status (yes/no).
* **children:** Number of children covered by insurance.
* **sex:** Gender of the insured person (male/female).
* **charges:** Individual medical costs billed by health insurance. (Target variable)


## Usage

1.  **Data Preparation:** Place the dataset (e.g., `insurance.csv`) in the project's data directory or modify the data loading code to point to your data source.

2.  **Running the Model:** Execute the main script to train and evaluate the model:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    * This script typically handles data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
    * You can modify the `main.py` file to adjust model parameters, training procedures, and evaluation metrics.

3.  **Making Predictions:** If you've included a prediction script or function, you can use it to predict charges for new data:

    ```python
    # Example (adjust based on your code)
    from predictor import predict_charges

    new_data = {
        'age': 30,
        'bmi': 25.5,
        'smoker': 'yes',
        'children': 2,
        'sex': 'male'
    }

    predicted_charge = predict_charges(new_data)
    print(f"Predicted insurance charge: ${predicted_charge:.2f}")

    ```

## Dependencies

* `pandas`
* `scikit-learn`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib` (optional, for visualization)
* `seaborn` (optional, for visualization)

## Model

The model used in this project could be a linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting, or any other suitable regression algorithm. The choice of model may depend on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the desired performance.
