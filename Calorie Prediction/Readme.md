# Calorie Expenditure Predictor

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts calorie expenditure based on several physiological and activity-related factors.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates the number of calories burned during physical activity. This model can be useful for fitness tracking, health monitoring, and personalized exercise recommendations.

## Data

The dataset used for this project typically includes the following features:

* **Gender:** Gender of the individual (male/female).
* **Age:** Age of the individual.
* **Height:** Height of the individual (in cm or inches).
* **Weight:** Weight of the individual (in kg or pounds).
* **Duration:** Duration of the activity (in minutes).
* **Body Temperature:** Body temperature during the activity (in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit).
* **Heart Rate:** Heart rate during the activity (in beats per minute).
* **Calories:** Calories burned during the activity (Target variable).


## Usage

1.  **Data Preparation:** Place the dataset (e.g., `calories.csv`) in the project's data directory or modify the data loading code to point to your data source.

2.  **Running the Model:** Execute the main script to train and evaluate the model:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    * This script handles data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
    * You can modify the `main.py` file to adjust model parameters, training procedures, and evaluation metrics.

3.  **Making Predictions:** If you've included a prediction script or function, you can use it to predict calorie expenditure for new data:

    ```python
    # Example (adjust based on your code)
    from predictor import predict_calories

    new_data = {
        'Gender': 'male',
        'Age': 30,
        'Height': 180,
        'Weight': 75,
        'Duration': 60,
        'Body Temperature': 37.5,
        'Heart Rate': 150
    }

    predicted_calories = predict_calories(new_data)
    print(f"Predicted calories burned: {predicted_calories:.2f}")
    ```

## Dependencies

* `pandas`
* `scikit-learn`
* `numpy`
* `matplotlib` (optional, for visualization)
* `seaborn` (optional, for visualization)

## Model

The model used in this project could be a linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting, or any other suitable regression algorithm. The choice of model may depend on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the desired performance.
